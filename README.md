# Vantage

A Laravel package that tracks and monitors your queue jobs. Automatically records job execution history, failures, retries, and provides a simple web interface to view everything.

## Installation

```bash
composer require houdaslassi/vantage
```

The package will automatically register itself and run migrations.

### Requirements

- Laravel 10.x or 11.x
- PHP 8.1 or higher
- One of the following databases:
  - MySQL 5.7+ / MariaDB 10.3+
  - PostgreSQL 9.6+
  - SQLite 3.8.8+

## Features

### Job Tracking

Every job gets tracked in the `queue_job_runs` table with:
- Job class, queue, connection
- Status (processing, processed, failed)
- Start/finish times and duration
- UUID for tracking across retries

### Failure Details

When jobs fail, we store the exception class, message, and full stack trace. Much easier to debug than Laravel's default failed_jobs table.

### Web Interface

Visit `/vantage` to see:
- Dashboard with stats and charts
- List of all jobs with filtering (by status, queue, tags, etc.)
- Individual job details
- Failed jobs page
- Tag statistics and filtering
- Recent batches tracking

**Jobs List** - View and filter all jobs:

**Job Details** - See full job information:

**Note:** The dashboard requires authentication by default. Make sure you're logged in or customize the `viewVantage` gate as described in the Configuration section.

### Retry Failed Jobs

```bash
php artisan vantage:retry {job_id}
```

Or use the web interface - just click retry on any failed job.

### Job Tagging

Jobs with tags (using Laravel's `tags()` method) are automatically tracked. Visit `/vantage/tags` to see:

- **Tags Analytics**: View statistics for all tags (total jobs, processed, failed, processing, success rate, average duration)
- **Search**: Filter tags by name in real-time
- **Sortable Columns**: Click any column header to sort by that metric
- **Clickable Tags**: Click a tag to view all jobs with that tag
- **Time Filters**: View data for last 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days

Filter and view jobs by tag in the web interface.

### Queue Depth Monitoring

Real-time queue depth tracking for all your queues. See how many jobs are pending in each queue with health status indicators.

Visit `/vantage` to see queue depths displayed with:
- Current pending job count per queue
- Health status (healthy/normal/warning/critical)
- Support for database and Redis queue drivers

### Performance Telemetry

Vantage automatically tracks performance metrics for your jobs:
- Memory usage (start, end, peak)
- CPU time (user and system)
- Execution duration

Telemetry can be configured via environment variables (see Environment Variables section below).

## Configuration

Publish the config file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=vantage-config
```

### Main Settings

- `store_payload` - Whether to store job payloads (for debugging/retry)
- `redact_keys` - Keys to redact from payloads (password, token, etc.)
- `retention_days` - How long to keep job history
- `notify.email` - Email to notify on failures
- `notify.slack_webhook` - Slack webhook URL for failures
- `telemetry.enabled` - Enable performance telemetry (memory/CPU)
- `telemetry.sample_rate` - Sampling rate (0.0-1.0, default: 1.0)
- `telemetry.capture_cpu` - Enable CPU time tracking

### Enable/Disable Package

To disable the package entirely (useful for staging environments):

```env
VANTAGE_ENABLED=false
```

When disabled:
- No job tracking occurs
- Routes are not registered
- Event listeners are not active
- Commands are not registered
- No database writes
- Gate authorization is not registered

Perfect for testing in staging without affecting production data!

### Multi-Database Support

If your application uses multiple databases, you can specify which database connection to use for storing queue job runs:

```env
VANTAGE_DATABASE_CONNECTION=mysql
```

This ensures the `queue_job_runs` table is created and accessed from the correct database connection. The package automatically detects your database driver (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) and uses the appropriate SQL syntax for queries.

### Authentication

Vantage uses Laravel's Gate system for authorization (similar to Horizon). **Users must be authenticated via Laravel's authentication system** to access the dashboard. By default, all authenticated users can access Vantage.

**Important:** Make sure your application has authentication set up (e.g., Laravel Breeze, Laravel Jetstream, or custom auth). The dashboard requires users to be logged in.

To customize access (e.g., only allow admins), override the `viewVantage` gate in your `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate;

public function boot(): void
{
    Gate::define('viewVantage', function ($user) {
        // Only allow admins
        return $user->isAdmin();
        
        // Or any other custom logic
        // return $user->hasRole('developer');
    });
}
```

To disable authentication entirely (not recommended for production):

```env
VANTAGE_AUTH_ENABLED=false
```

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
composer test
```

## Commands

- `vantage:retry {id}` - Retry a failed job
- `vantage:cleanup-stuck` - Clean up jobs stuck in processing state

## Environment Variables

```env
# Master switch - Enable/disable entire package (default: true)
VANTAGE_ENABLED=true
